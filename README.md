In this project, we investigate whether the countries that suffer the most from extreme 
weather events and air pollution are also the ones who emit the most greenhouse gasses.

## About

We conducted two regression analyses: 
1. the first examines the association between countries’ greenhouse gas emissions
   (independent variable) and their global climate risk indices (dependent variable).
3. the second checks the association between countries’ greenhouse gas emissions
   (dependent variable) and their air pollution (target/dependent variable).

The data used in our analysis was originally derived from the following sources:

### [Global Climate Risk Index by Country](https://www.germanwatch.org/sites/default/files/20-2-01e%20Global%20Climate%20Risk%20Index%202020_14.pdf)

This dataset can be found on pages 37 to 43 of the linked pdf. It lists each country’s climate 
risk index and is published by a group called Germanwatch. The climate risk index “indicates 
a level of exposure and vulnerability to extreme events” (page 4). 

### [Greenhouse Gas Emissions by Country](https://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/report_2023#data_download)

Data is collected from the “EDGAR GHG emissions” file in the “Data Download” section of the 
linked website. This dataset contains total, per capita, and per sector greenhouse gas emissions 
for each country from 1970 to 2022. 

### [Air Quality by Country](https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/air-pollution/who-air-quality-database/2022)

This dataset is under the header “Excel Version - WHO Air Quality Database (Update 2022)” in the 
attached link. This dataset contains various air pollutant levels broken down by country and 
city/locality. For this analysis, air pollution will be estimated using concentrations of nitrogen dioxide. 

### [Paris Agreement Data](https://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XXVII-7-d&chapter=27&clang=_en)

Data on which Countries are a part of the Paris Agreement and when they signed the agreement.
